# Remote Collections

Remote Collections in Monicon allow you to fetch and use icons directly from remote URLs. These collections are configured using the `loadRemoteCollection` function, which maps icon names to their respective URLs. This setup is perfect for integrating third-party or dynamically fetched icons into your project.

```ts filename="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import monicon from "@monicon/vite";
import { loadRemoteCollection } from "@monicon/loader";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    monicon({
      customCollections: {
        remote: loadRemoteCollection({
          download: "https://api.iconify.design/lucide:cloud-download.svg",
          attachment: "https://api.iconify.design/ri:attachment-2.svg",
        }),
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Usage

You can now use Monicon in your React components. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use icons from your remote collection in a React component:

```tsx filename="src/App.tsx"
import { Monicon } from "@monicon/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Monicon name="remote:download" size={24} />
      <Monicon name="remote:attachment" size={24} />
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```
