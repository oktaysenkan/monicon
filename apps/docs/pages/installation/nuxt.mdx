# Install Monicon with Nuxt

Setting up Monicon with Nuxt is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration steps to get started with Monicon in your Nuxt project.

<Steps>

## Install

First, you’ll need to install the necessary dependencies for Monicon. In your project directory, run the following command.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @monicon/core @monicon/vue @monicon/nuxt
```

Next, install the development dependency @iconify/json for icon sets. This package provides a comprehensive collection of icons that you can easily integrate into your project.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i -D @iconify/json

# or specific icon sets
npm i -D @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/feather
```

## Configure Nuxt

Now that the dependencies are installed, you’ll need to configure Nuxt to use Monicon.

```ts filename="nuxt.config.ts" copy
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@monicon/nuxt"],
});
```

## Configure Monicon

Now you need to configure Monicon to use the icon sets you want in your project. Also you can use `monicon.config.js` file to configure Monicon.

```ts filename="monicon.config.ts" copy
import type { MoniconOptions } from "@monicon/core";

export default {
  icons: [
    "mdi:home",
    "feather:activity",
    "logos:active-campaign",
    "lucide:badge-check",
  ],
} satisfies MoniconOptions;
```

The `icons` array in the configuration specifies the icon sets you want to use in your project. You can add more icon sets as needed.

For a complete list of available icon sets, refer to the [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) website.
