# Install Monicon with Remix

Setting up Monicon with Remix and Vite is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration steps to get started with Monicon in your Remix project.

<Steps>

## Install

To get started, you’ll need to install the necessary dependencies for Monicon. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @monicon/core @monicon/react @monicon/vite
```

Now you should install the development dependency `@iconify/json` for the icon sets. This package provides a comprehensive collection of icons that can be easily integrated into your project.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i -D @iconify/json

# or specific icon sets
npm i -D @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/feather
```

## Configure Vite

Now that the dependencies are installed, you’ll need to configure Vite to use Monicon.

```ts filename="vite.config.ts" copy
import { vitePlugin as remix } from "@remix-run/dev";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import monicon from "@monicon/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [remix(), monicon()],
});
```

## Configure Monicon

Now you need to configure Monicon to use the icon sets you want in your project. Also you can use `monicon.config.js` file to configure Monicon.

```ts filename="monicon.config.ts" copy
import type { MoniconOptions } from "@monicon/core";

export default {
  icons: [
    "mdi:home",
    "feather:activity",
    "logos:active-campaign",
    "lucide:badge-check",
  ],
} satisfies MoniconOptions;
```

<Callout>
The `icons` array in the configuration specifies the icon sets you want to use in your project. You can add more icon sets as needed.

For a complete list of available icon sets, refer to the [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) website.

## Usage

You can now use Monicon in your React components. Here’s an example of how to use Monicon in a React component.

```tsx filename="app/routes/_index.tsx" copy
import { Monicon } from "@monicon/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Monicon name="mdi:home" />
      <Monicon name="logos:active-campaign" size={30} />
      <Monicon name="feather:activity" color="red" />
      <Monicon name="lucide:badge-check" size={24} strokeWidth={4} />
    </main>
  );
}

export default App;
```
