# Install Monicon with Next.js

Setting up Monicon with Next.js is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration steps to get started with Monicon in your Next.js project.

<Steps>

## Install

To get started, you’ll need to install the necessary dependencies for Monicon. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i @monicon/core @monicon/react @monicon/webpack
```

Now you should install the development dependency `@iconify/json` for the icon sets. This package provides a comprehensive collection of icons that can be easily integrated into your project.

```sh npm2yarn copy
npm i -D @iconify/json

# or specific icon sets
npm i -D @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/feather
```

## Configure Next

If you want to use Monicon with Next.js, you’ll need to configure Next.js.

```js filename="next.config.js" copy
const { MoniconPlugin } = require("@monicon/webpack");

const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.plugins.push(new MoniconPlugin());

    return config;
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Configure Monicon

Now you need to configure Monicon to use the icon sets you want in your project. Also you can use `monicon.config.js` file to configure Monicon.

```ts filename="monicon.config.ts" copy
import type { MoniconOptions } from "@monicon/core";

export default {
  icons: [
    "mdi:home",
    "feather:activity",
    "logos:active-campaign",
    "lucide:badge-check",
  ],
} satisfies MoniconOptions;
```

<Callout>
The `icons` array in the configuration specifies the icon sets you want to use in your project. You can add more icon sets as needed.

For a complete list of available icon sets, refer to the [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) website.
