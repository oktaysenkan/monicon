# Install Monicon with Next.js

Setting up Monicon with Next.js is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration steps to get started with Monicon in your Next.js project.

<Steps>

## Install

To get started, you’ll need to install the necessary dependencies for Monicon. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @monicon/react @monicon/webpack
```

Now you should install the development dependency `@iconify/json` for the icon sets. This package provides a comprehensive collection of icons that can be easily integrated into your project.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @iconify/json

# or specific icon sets
npm i -D @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/feather
```

## Configure Next

If you want to use Monicon with Next.js, you’ll need to configure Next.js.

```js filename="next.config.js"
const { MoniconPlugin } = require("@monicon/webpack");

const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.plugins.push(
      new MoniconPlugin({
        icons: [
          "mdi:home",
          "feather:activity",
          "logos:active-campaign",
        ],
      })
    );

    return config;
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

<Callout>
The `icons` array in the `monicon` plugin configuration specifies the icon sets you want to use in your project. You can add more icon sets as needed.

For a complete list of available icon sets, refer to the [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) website.
