# Install Monicon with React (Rspack)

Setting up Monicon with React and Rspack is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the installation and configuration steps to get started with Monicon in your React project.

<Steps>

## Install

To get started, you’ll need to install the necessary dependencies for Monicon. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @monicon/react @monicon/rspack
```

Now you should install the development dependency `@iconify/json` for the icon sets. This package provides a comprehensive collection of icons that can be easily integrated into your project.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @iconify/json

# or specific icon sets
npm i -D @iconify-json/mdi @iconify-json/feather
```

## Configure Rspack

Now that the dependencies are installed, you’ll need to configure Rollup to use Monicon.

```ts filename="rspack.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from "@rspack/cli";
import MoniconPlugin from "@monicon/rspack";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    new MoniconPlugin({
      icons: [
        "mdi:home",
        "feather:activity",
        "logos:active-campaign",
      ],
    }),
  ]
});
```

<Callout>
The `icons` array in the `monicon` plugin configuration specifies the icon sets you want to use in your project. You can add more icon sets as needed.

For a complete list of available icon sets, refer to the [Icones](https://icones.js.org/) website.
