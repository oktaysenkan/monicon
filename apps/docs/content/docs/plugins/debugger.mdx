description: Debug the icon generation process
---

The Debugger plugin logs information about the icon generation process, helping you understand what's happening during build time.

## Usage

```ts twoslash title="monicon.config.ts"
import { react, clean, debuggerPlugin } from "@monicon/core/plugins";
import { MoniconConfig } from "@monicon/core";

export default {
  icons: ["mdi:home", "lucide:heart"],
  plugins: [
    clean({ patterns: ["src/components/icons"] }),
    react({ outputPath: "src/components/icons" }),
    debuggerPlugin(),
  ],
} satisfies MoniconConfig;
```

## Options

### `enabled`

Enable or disable the debugger plugin.

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`

```ts twoslash
import { debuggerPlugin } from "@monicon/core/plugins";

debuggerPlugin({ enabled: false });

debuggerPlugin({ enabled: true });
```

## What It Logs

The Debugger plugin logs information at various stages of the generation process:

### On Plugins Load

Logs when all plugins are loaded.

```
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] On plugins load 3 plugins
```

### Before Generate

Logs the number of icons about to be generated.

```
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] Before generate 2 icons
```

### After Generate

Logs the number of icons that were generated.

```
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] After generate 2 icons
```

### Before Write Files

Logs the number of files about to be written to disk.

```
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] Before write files 2 files
```

### After Write Files

Logs the number of files that were written to disk.

```
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] After write files 2 files
```

## Example Output

When running your build with the debugger plugin enabled, you'll see output like:

```bash
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] On plugins load 3 plugins
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] Before generate 12 icons
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] After generate 12 icons
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] Before write files 12 files
[Monicon - Debugger Plugin] After write files 12 files
```

## Use Cases

The Debugger plugin is useful for:

- **Development** - Understanding what's happening during icon generation
- **Debugging** - Troubleshooting issues with icon generation
- **Performance** - Monitoring how many icons and files are being processed
- **Verification** - Confirming that icons are being generated as expected

## Plugin Order

The Debugger plugin can be placed anywhere in the plugins array. It's typically placed last so it logs information about all other plugins:

```ts twoslash
import { react, clean, debuggerPlugin } from "@monicon/core/plugins";
import { MoniconConfig } from "@monicon/core";

export default {
  icons: ["mdi:home"],
  plugins: [
    clean({ patterns: ["src/components/icons"] }),
    react({ outputPath: "src/components/icons" }),
    debuggerPlugin(), // Last to log all plugin activity
  ],
} satisfies MoniconConfig;
```
